###🔑 HOW IT WORKS

Filester plugin helps you easily manage WordPress files so that you don’t have to access directories via FTP or cPanel. 

This plugin creates a new menu **File Manager** in your WordPress dashboard. From then on, you can view all server files, configuration, and media files on your current WordPress website.

You can edit, copy, upload/download files/folders to your server from File Manager section. This toolbar is similar to the settings in an FTP client. It allows you to preview, edit, upload, download, duplicate and delete files or folders.

With Filester, it's easy to modify the auto-update mechanism with each new version of WordPress. You can quickly **search for specific text or code** within your WordPress files and replace it efficiently.

With built-in code editors, you can edit code files with syntax highlighting and code completion features for themes, plugins, and custom code snippets. It takes one click to download a plugin's **ZIP file** to your local storage. It helps track changes made to files and revert to previous versions if needed.

All webmasters can also [download WordPress media library](https://ninjateam.org/download-wordpress-media-library/) using Filester download options as well.

###🎏 COMPATIBILITY

Filester works seamlessly with all major WordPress themes, page builders, and website builders.
